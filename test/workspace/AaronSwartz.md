# Aaron Swartz

Aaron Hillel Swartz[^1] (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS, [^3] the Markdown publishing format, [^4] the organization Creative Commons, [^lessig] and the website framework web.py, [^6] and was a co-founder of the social news site Reddit. He was given the title of co-founder of Reddit by Y Combinator owner Paul Graham after the formation of Not a Bug, Inc. (a merger of Swartz's project Infogami and Redbrick Solutions, [^7] a company run by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman).

Swartz's[^1] work also focused on civic awareness and activism.[^8][^9] He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig.[^10][^11] He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.

In 2011, Swartz[^1] was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT.[^12][^13] Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, [^14] carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of \$1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.[^15]

Swartz[^1] declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.[^16][^17]

In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame.[^18]
